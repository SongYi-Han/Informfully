{"N53234":{"text":"A recent storm on the Outer Banks unearthed an old shipwreck buried on the beach in Hatteras Island. A local bar shared photos of the old wooden ship in its final resting place in the area known as \u201cThe Graveyard of the Atlantic.\u201d \u201cA Wreck across the street from The Wreck! A lot of sand has washed out with this Nor\u2019Easter & look what\u2019s been exposed!\u201d The Wreck Tiki Bar in Hatteras, North Carolina, said on Facebook. The wreck appeared not far from the North Carolina Maritime Center\u2019s Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum. Mary Ellen Riddle, with the museum, said she did not get a chance to see the wreck before it was covered again in sand. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to wash up,\u201d she said in a phone interview with McClatchy news group. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what does wash up.\u201d She said the most interesting thing to appear on Outer Banks beaches recently was a civil war cannon ball. North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks have long been treacherous for sailors, and countless shipwrecks dating back to the 16th century earned the state\u2019s coast the name \u201cThe Graveyard of the Atlantic,\u201d according to the National Parks Service. \u201cTo follow coastal trade routes, thousands of these vessels had to round not only North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands, which lie 30 miles off the mainland, but also the infamous Diamond Shoals, a treacherous, always-shifting series of shallow, underwater sandbars extending eight miles out from Cape Hatteras,\u201d the Parks Service said. Ships drew close to the Outer Banks to catch currents running along the eastern seaboard. \u201cFlowing like massive rivers in the sea, the cold-water Labrador Current from the north and the warm Gulf Stream from the south converge just offshore from the cape,\u201d according to NPS. Storms and shifting sands reveal the Outer Banks\u2019 dangerous history from time to time. Earlier this year, the remains of the four-masted G.A Kohler were visible on the beach near Salvo, North Carolina, according to Cape Hatteras National Seashore and The Charlotte Observer. \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u00a92019 The News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)

It was reportedly owned by the same family in Oregon from new until purchased by the seller in 2015. Restoration included new carpet, upholstery, drapes and exterior paintwork, plus refurbished bumpers, grille inserts and steel hubcaps. What must be a catastrophically slow Ford 300-cubic-inch inline-six is paired with a three-speed automatic that was rebuilt in 2016, along with myriad other mechanical repairs and maintenance.

But just once, she threw caution to the wind, participating in a risky photoshoot against her aides' (and mother's) best advice.\u00a0It's true: on one occasion, the Queen dared to pose with her hands in her pockets. Royal dresser Angela Kelly revealed that she'd long known about the Queen's \"secret wish\" to have her photograph taken while she had her hands in her pockets\u2014and Kelly also knew that the monarch's advisors warned her such casualness might \"bring the monarchy down,\" and were \"not suitable for the public eye.\" The Queen Mother, too, believed such an action to be unthinkable.But that didn't stop Kelly from making the Queen's wish come true. The royal dresser was working on her first book, and felt this project provided the Queen with the perfect opportunity to indulge in her wildest fantasy. And in her new book, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe, Kelly reveals how it all went down.The Queen signed on, but not without hesitation. \"The Queen looked at me in amazement as I asked whether she knew the potential implications of the photographs,\" Kelly writes, per the Telegraph. \"She didn't take long to answer: yes, she would do it and, yes, she was sure.\"On the day of the shoot, though, the Queen proved more than up to the challenge. Photographer Barry Jeffery began to speak to her about his plan for the shoot, when the monarch took charge of the situation. \"Within moments, the Queen raised her hand respectfully and Barry immediately stopped talking,\" Kelly writes.$16.99;\u00a0Shop Now\"'No Barry, this is how we're going to do it,' she said.

More than 315,000 residents in those four communities in San Bernardino County, about 70 miles north east of Los Angeles, are in the path should floodwaters overtake the dam, according to US Census data.The Mojave River Dam is an ungated flood control structure built in 1971 that is located at the northern side of the San Bernardino Mountains.Southwest of the dam, on the other side of the mountains, residents are fleeing wildfires in the region. The dam is located on the \"desert\" side of the mountains, so the current wildfires don't add any risk to the flood threat, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said.In fiscal year 2018, an assessment showed that the dam \"could fail should water flow over the top of it,\" a statement from USACOE said. \"The change was the result of recent risk assessment findings that during an extreme flood event, water could exceed the design capacity of the dam and overtop it,\" the statement said. \"This could potentially result in dam failure.\"Flood waters could even reach Baker, which is more than 140 miles downstream of the dam, the statement said.But it's unlikely a storm of that magnitude would occur, Col. Aaron Barta, commander of the Corps' Los Angeles District said. \"The dam has never experienced spillway flow or a flood event that has loaded the dam significantly,\" Barta said. \"This is a storm that is unlikely to occur, but it is nonetheless a real possibility and one we must be prepared for.\"No rain is expected in California for the next seven days, Brink said, and this particular region doesn't get a lot of rain anyway. The rainy season, which runs from December through February, normally only brings less than 2 inches of precipitation during those three months.The Army Corps says the agency is working with local governments to help improve flood-risk awareness and emergency preparedness so that anyone in the communities threatened by the potential breach have the tools they need to survive.","date":1572825600000,"category":-1,"sentiment":-0.7351,"complexity":18.0048542714,"named_entities":[{"text":"the US Army Corps of Engineers","alternative":["the US Army Corps of Engineers"],"spans":[[164,194]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"Hesperia","alternative":["Hesperia"],"spans":[[228,236]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"Barstow","alternative":["Barstow"],"spans":[[238,245]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"Apple Valley","alternative":["Apple Valley"],"spans":[[247,259]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"US Census","alternative":["US Census"],"spans":[[542,551]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"CNN","alternative":["CNN"],"spans":[[927,930]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"USACOE","alternative":["USACOE"],"spans":[[1085,1091]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"Corps'","alternative":["Corps'"],"spans":[[1530,1536]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"The Army Corps","alternative":["The Army Corps"],"spans":[[2072,2086]],"frequency":1,"label":"ORG"},{"text":"California","alternative":["California"],"spans":[[61,71],[1819,1829]],"frequency":2,"label":"GPE"},{"text":"Victorville","alternative":["Victorville"],"spans":[[264,275]],"frequency":1,"label":"GPE"},{"text":"San Bernardino County","alternative":["San Bernardino County"],"spans":[[411,432]],"frequency":1,"label":"GPE"},{"text":"Los Angeles","alternative":["Los Angeles","Los Angeles District"],"spans":[[463,474],[1537,1557]],"frequency":2,"label":"GPE"},{"text":"Haley Brink","alternative":["Haley Brink","Brink"],"spans":[[945,956],[1855,1860]],"frequency":2,"label":"PERSON"},{"text":"Baker","alternative":["Baker"],"spans":[[1360,1365]],"frequency":1,"label":"PERSON"},{"text":"Aaron Barta","alternative":["Aaron Barta","Barta"],"spans":[[1500,1511],[1666,1671]],"frequency":2,"label":"PERSON"}],"enriched_ne":[{"the US Army Corps of Engineers":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["the US Army Corps of Engineers"]}},{"Hesperia":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["Hesperia"]}},{"Barstow":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["Barstow"]}},{"Apple Valley":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["Apple Valley"]}},{"US Census":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["US Census"]}},{"CNN":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["CNN"]}},{"USACOE":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["USACOE"]}},{"Corps'":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["Corps'"]}},{"The Army Corps":{"frequency":1,"alternative":["The Army Corps"]}},{"Haley Brink":{"key":"Haley Brink","frequency":2,"alternative":["Haley Brink","Brink"]}},{"Baker":{"key":"Baker","frequency":1,"alternative":["Baker"]}},{"Aaron Barta":{"key":"Aaron Barta","frequency":2,"alternative":["Aaron Barta","Barta"]}}],"region":[],"party":{},"min_maj_ratio":{"mainstream":[1.0,0.0]},"story":0},"N38895":{"text":"Video by Yahoo\u00a0Rep.

For heavy social media users like Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, the most immediate response is probably to snap a pic and post it on the 'Gram, with little thought of what may or may not be included in the photo of the critter.That's how The Rock, who coaxed a tiny lizard into a photo opp, wound up posting a closeup of his hand\u2014specifically, his right palm\u2014to his 158 million Instagram followers. While Johnson's caption about snacking on the little lizard was darkly funny (and maybe slightly alarming), the state of his hand is what really catches the eye. Everyone knows that The Rock trains super hard\u2014the actor shows off his gains online and the big screen, and he's the owner of the biggest muscles currently in Hollywood. But we don't often see the more subtle effects of all that iron work, like the leathery, callused, worn skin on the big guy's palms.The reaction from Johnson's followers was split, as most people couldn't shake the state of his hand. Most people left some remark about the how it was clearly the hand of a working man, but Ballers co-star Rob Corddry called him out, commenting \"Your hands are gross.\"What are we to think? Is Johnson's rough palm a mark of legitimacy, giving him some claim of superiority over a man with less rugged hands? Or is it gross, and a good reason to tell him to invest in a solid pair of gloves and a solid skincare regimen? From a lifter's perspective\u2014which, I assume, is where Johnson is coming from\u2014his calluses are more than just a point of pride. The toughened state of his hand proves that Johnson isn't skimping on reps that will help to build his grip strength, which is essential for lifting big weights and your overall health. Once you introduce an extra layer of material into the equation, your ability to really squeeze to engage your forearms diminishes. \"In theory, you're \"protecting\" your skin from the wear and pounding of metal bars, but you're also losing a ton of natural grip training,\" Men's Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. said when we last addressed the topic. \"The best and most organic way for you to train your grip has always been to grip with intent. But you can't truly grip with gloves, and you lose the ability to truly feel what you're gripping.\" In short, don't lift with gloves if you want the best possible results for both strength and size. If you really need help with your grip, use straps or chalk instead\u2014as it appears Johnson does at times\u2014but only when absolutely necessary. That said, there's nothing wrong with taking care of your hands. Tough hands do not a tough guy make, after all. While some guys might own their calluses as a point of pride, others might have shudder at the dry, cracked skin of Johnson's palm the minute it crossed their timeline. $11.14\u00a0Shop NowIf you're one of those guys, never fear. Check out these hand creams to keep your palms in good condition (when you're outside of the weight room, since you definitely don't want to attempt a big lift post-lotion). If you're wary of skincare products, start with this non-threatening option from O'Keefe's. Unfortunately, The Rock himself didn't weigh-in on his post. But after fans flooded Corddry with comments, the comedian responded with an update from \"Duane\" about how the hands were wrought: \"Oh and btw, it wasn't hard work and lifting weights that made his hands so gross,\" Corddry wrote. \"It was from all the high-fiving.

He\u2019ll either still be unemployed, or he'll finally have a job.Since he hasn\u2019t taken one snap in the league in almost three years, this either\/or option is real progress.From NFL plays to college sports scores, all the top sports news you need to know every day.After days, weeks and months of controversy and uncertainty, an overwhelming national cultural controversy that has consumed one quarterback, the president of the United States and our most popular sports league has a chance to have a happy ending.There now is a real shot that Kaepernick might be signed by an NFL team. Who would have thought that sentence could be written after everything that has happened since 2016?Black-listed by NFL owners because of his decision to protest social injustice and police brutality during the national anthem, Kaepernick deserves this opportunity, no matter how strange the timing is.THE BIG QUESTION: Which NFL teams would be a fit for Colin Kaepernick? Ranking all from 32 to 1Even though he has been out of football for nearly three years, he\u2019s still just 32, and has said all along that he continues to work out and stay in shape. Just this season, 51 quarterbacks have started for the 32 teams in the league. Since Kaepernick became a free agent, nearly every club has needed a quarterback for some reason or other.Nonetheless, the only man to pass for 250 yards and rush for 150 in a game, the man who took the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl in February 2013, has remained an unsigned free agent. As a football decision, it makes no sense. As a cultural and historic choice, it is a disgrace.Even Donald Trump has moved on. This surprising development happened after Nike made Kaepernick the face of a successful marketing campaign last year.\u00a0After using Kaepernick\u2019s protest against social injustice as a political rallying cry with his right-wing base for months, Trump suddenly retreated.Why? The best guess is that Trump realized Nike was actually wise to use Kaepernick to sell its products. Younger consumers \u2013 a demographic that should be crucial to the NFL \u2013 apparently couldn\u2019t get enough of Kaepernick. They liked his social consciousness, or didn\u2019t care one way or the other.Trump loved going up against Kaepernick when he could turn him into a racial issue. But taking on capitalism? That\u2019s when it seems\u00a0Trump decided enough was enough.It appears the NFL has come to the same conclusion. My USA TODAY Sports colleague Mike Jones reports that hip-hop icon and NFL social justice initiative partner Shawn \"Jay-Z\"\u00a0Carter has had many discussions with Commissioner Roger Goodell about the need to try to help Kaepernick get back into the league.Add in an NFL memo that said the league office has received multiple inquiries this season about Kaepernick\u2019s physical and mental readiness to play, and you have a fitting end to one of the most polarizing and confounding sports stories of the decade: an unprecedented mid-November second chance for the best-known free agent in all of sports.Follow USA TODAY Sports' Christine Brennan on Twitter\u00a0@cbrennansports.If you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
